# Hypercar 

A project I did in 2020 for my Aerospace Engineering thesis on Faculty of Power and Aeronautical Engineering at Warsaw University of Technology.

The car draws main inspiration from Aston Martin Valkyrie, whose aerodynamic design I wanted to understand and replicate. The other important influence were LMP1 racecars and Elemental RP1 sports car, which all have interesting front diffuser solutions.

Finally, the results are not particularly impressive - I struggled with the CAD model and with finishing the project in time (it took entire year instead of standard 4-5 months).

The 3D model in this repository is only for visual inspection since all thin surfaces were heavily thickened for 3D printing - I don't think you'd get any interesting CFD results from them. I can't find original CAD files, but I'll upload them in case I find them in the future.
